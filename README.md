MinecraftModdingHelp
====================

The unofficial minecraft modding help repo!

IRC can be great but things get lost in it and it is very unorgaized. The forums work but you don't get the help you would on IRC and it is still very hard to get around (or log in)!

If you need some help, just create a ticket on the right hand side.
